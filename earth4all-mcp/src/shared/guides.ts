export const MODEL_OVERVIEW_GUIDE = `# Earth4All Model Overview

Earth4All is a system dynamics integrated assessment model (IAM) that simulates global sustainability from 1980 to 2100. It was created by the Club of Rome, the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, the Stockholm Resilience Centre, and BI Norwegian Business School.

## 12 Interconnected Sectors

| Sector | Key Outputs |
|--------|-------------|
| **Population** | Total population, workforce size, fertility, mortality, life expectancy |
| **Output** | GDP, consumption, investment, government spending, employment |
| **Public** | Public spending, tax revenue, government debt, budget distribution |
| **Labour Market** | Unemployment rate, worker share of output, participation rate |
| **Demand** | Income distribution (owners, workers, government), inequality index |
| **Inventory** | Capacity utilisation, inflation rate |
| **Finance** | Interest rates, financial system dynamics |
| **Energy** | Fossil/renewable production, GHG emissions, energy costs, electrification |
| **Food & Land** | Crop production, agricultural emissions, food costs, land use |
| **Wellbeing** | Social trust, social tension, Average Wellbeing Index (AWBI) |
| **Climate** | Global warming (°C), CO₂ concentration, sea level rise |
| **Other** | Composite sustainability and performance metrics |

## How It Works

The model is a system of ~500 ordinary differential equations (ODEs) solved from 1980 to 2100.
Each sector feeds variables into other sectors through causal feedback loops.
For example:
- Population growth → labour supply → GDP → investment → energy demand → emissions → warming → agricultural impact → food costs → wellbeing

## Too Little Too Late (TLTL)
The baseline scenario modelling current policy trajectories. No extraordinary policy shifts.
- All turnaround parameters remain at zero/default values
- Warming reaches ~2.5°C by 2100
- Population peaks around 9 billion then declines
- Inequality persists, social tensions rise
- Wellbeing stagnates

## Giant Leap (GL)
The transformative scenario with all five turnarounds active.
- 21 parameters are changed from TLTL defaults
- Warming stabilises below 2°C
- Extreme poverty ends by mid-century
- Inequality falls significantly
- Wellbeing doubles by 2100

### 5. Clean Energy Transition
Net zero emissions through renewables and carbon capture. Parameters:
- energy.GFCO2SCCS = 0.9 (90% CO₂ sources with CCS)
- energy.EROCEPA2022 = 0.004 (extra energy productivity growth)
- energy.GFNE = 1 (100% new electrification)
- energy.GREF = 1 (100% renewable electricity)
- climate.ERDN2OKF2022 = 0.01 (N₂O reduction)
- climate.ERDCH4KC2022 = 0.01 (CH₄ reduction)
- climate.DACCO22100 = 8 (direct air capture, GtCO₂/y by 2100)

## Custom Scenarios
Use create_project to start from either TLTL or GL, then use set_parameter or set_turnaround to create custom configurations. Every parameter change should cite a source.

export const PARAMETERS_GUIDE = `# Earth4All Parameter Reference

Parameters control the behaviour of the Earth4All model. Each belongs to one of 12 sectors.

## Parameter Naming Convention
Parameters use abbreviated uppercase names from the original Vensim model.
- Prefixed by sector context (e.g., population parameters start with letters related to demographics)
- Suffixed with year (e.g., \`2022\`) when they represent policy changes starting in that year
- TLTL defaults are typically 0 for policy parameters (no intervention)
- GL values represent the transformative scenario

## How to Use Parameters
1. Use list_scenarios to understand the base scenarios
2. Use create_project to start a project
3. Use preview_model to see current parameter values
4. Use set_parameter to change individual parameters (cite your source!)
5. Use set_turnaround to enable/disable entire turnaround bundles
6. Use run_simulation to run the model and see results

export const TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE = `# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

### Julia not found
**Error**: "Julia worker failed to start"
**Fix**: Ensure Julia is installed and available in PATH. Set JULIA_CMD environment variable if needed.

### Earth4All.jl not found
**Error**: "Failed to load Earth4All.jl"
**Fix**: Set EARTH4ALL_SRC environment variable to the Earth4All.jl src/ directory.
\`\`\`bash
export EARTH4ALL_SRC=/path/to/Earth4All.jl/src
\`\`\`

### First simulation is slow (30-60 seconds)
This is normal. Julia needs to JIT-compile Earth4All.jl on first use. Subsequent simulations will be fast (1-5 seconds) thanks to the persistent worker process.

### Simulation timeout
The default timeout is 5 minutes. If Julia compilation takes longer (first run), increase SIMULATION_TIMEOUT_MS.

### Unknown parameter warning
If you see "Unknown parameter sector.PARAM — skipped", check that the parameter name is spelled correctly. Parameter names are case-sensitive uppercase abbreviations.

### NaN or Inf in results
Some extreme parameter combinations can cause numerical instability. Try:
1. Check your parameter values are within reasonable ranges
2. Start from a known-good scenario (TLTL or GL)
3. Make smaller changes incrementally

### Project not found
Projects are stored in data/projects/. If you restart the server, previously created projects persist. Use list_projects to see available projects.

### Warming (cli.OW)
- TLTL: reaches ~2.5°C by 2100
- GL: peaks ~1.9°C around 2060, stabilises/declines
